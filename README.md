# Project-3-A-B-Testing
Data Science Bootcamp @WBS Coding School

This is just a placeholder, since our third project in the Data Science Bootcamp @WBS Coding School was just giving a short speech about A/B Testing. I also studied sociology a while ago, so that bit o statistics wasnÂ´t troubleing me.
